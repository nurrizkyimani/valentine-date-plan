In this moment of hearts aflutter and dreams taking wing,
I find myself lost in thoughts of you, my everything.
Like stars that brighten the darkest night,
Your presence fills my world with pure delight.

Would you grace me with the honor of being my Valentine?
Together, let's create a memory divine,
Starting with a romantic evening, just us two,
At a place as special as my feelings for you.`,
